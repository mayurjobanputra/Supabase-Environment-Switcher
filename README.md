# Supabase Environment Switcher

A tool that generates GitHub Actions workflows to automatically switch between development and production Supabase environments during pull requests.

## Overview

This tool simplifies the process of managing multiple Supabase environments in your development workflow. It automatically generates a GitHub Actions workflow that handles the switching between your development and production Supabase environments when creating pull requests.

## Features

- üîÑ Automatic environment switching during pull requests
- üîí Secure handling of environment variables
- üîç Smart detection and replacement of Supabase URLs and project IDs
- ‚ö° Browser-based workflow generation
- üõ°Ô∏è No server-side processing - all data stays in your browser

## How It Works

When you create a pull request from your development branch to your production branch, the generated workflow will:

1. Search through your codebase for the development Supabase URL
2. Replace it with your production Supabase URL
3. Update any project IDs and anon keys automatically
4. Commit these changes back to your pull request

### Technical Details

- Uses GitHub Actions' powerful file manipulation capabilities
- Searches through multiple file types (.js, .ts, .env)
- Handles both full URLs and project IDs
- Maintains your environment variables securely
- Runs only on pull requests to your production branch

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Database Sync

While this workflow helps switch between development and production environments during pull requests, it does not handle database schema or data synchronization. You'll need to manage database migrations separately using:

- Supabase Database Branching
- Manual migrations
- Other database synchronization methods

This ensures your production database schema matches your development environment.

## Best Practices

1. **Review Changes**: Always review the automated changes before merging pull requests
2. **Branch Protection**: Keep your production branch protected
3. **Environment Branches**: Use environment-specific branches for development
4. **Schema Sync**: Regularly update your development environment to match production schema
5. **Testing**: Test the workflow thoroughly in a non-production environment first

## Getting Started

1. Visit the tool at [URL]
2. Enter your Supabase development and production environment details
3. Configure your branch names
4. Generate your workflow
5. Copy the generated workflow to your repository's `.github/workflows` directory

## Security

- All processing happens in your browser
- No data is sent to any server
- Your credentials and environment variables never leave your device
- The tool only generates the workflow file - you maintain full control over its implementation
